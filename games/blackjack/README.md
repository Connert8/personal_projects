# - Project Overview - # 
This project is my first wihtout instruction nor aid. I'm proud that I learned from my college course enough to make what I wanted to make. With that, this is taking my instructors advice by coding more. This is the first of a long line of coding projects that I'm passionate about, all in pursuit of knowledge.

# - Process - #
The process of making this was pretty simple. I just started with what I knew and branched from there. It started in one big file, though it began to become hard to navigate so I did what I wanted to in class assignments and broke the program up into files. After the files were complete, I began to read data from a text file for user persistence. Afterall it is more fun to rack up chips, even if they're back to zero after a single hand.

# - Challenges - #
The biggest challenge of this program was getting the loading and saving functions to work. Getting the computer to accurately read, save, delete, and rewrite the line specified was difficult. Of course it was way easy once it got working but I'm still getting used to reading files. Along with this, enum use and struct organization was also difficult. The structs started as classes, but soon the getters made things more complicated than I was expecting. I'd like to make them into classes for more secure data operations, though we'll see if I get to that.

# - Learning - #
I learned a lot about code organization and forward programming. I intended from the beginning to make sure future additions and modifications were easy and not algorithm shattering. I've heard horror stories of spaghetti code and that one change can create a butterfly effect of bugs. With this program, I didn't run into any of that cascading mess.

# - What Do I Want to Add? - #
I'd like to add a multiplayer function with many players. Also, it may be fun to add other cards that have slight twists on the normal cards with boosts and advantages.

# - What Would Have I Done Differently? - #
I would have started with classes for everything. With the enums not being "enum class", their type can give errors in some cases. Also, I would have split the structs/classes into seperate files early on so that organization is cleaner and coding is easier.

# - Final Thoughts - #
Overall this was really fun to code. It's my first project without a set deadline, which is great as it allows me to add whatever I need without the stress of if I have enough time. I'm excited to start my next project.
